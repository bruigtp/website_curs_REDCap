## Applied Biostatistics Course with R <img src="WWW/logo.png" align="right" width="300"/>

This course is an introduction to the use of the open-source software R for clinical data analysis. The course covers the theoretical foundations of descriptive statistics, between-group comparisons, hypothesis testing, linear and logistic regression, and survival analysis. These sessions will be combined with more hands-on sessions where students will see real-world examples using R. Students will also learn how to interpret results obtained with R and how to use these results to make decisions.

In this website you will find how to install all the materials in your computer using R (<a href = "https://bruigtp.github.io/website_curs_bioestadistica_R/how_to.html">Install materials</a>) and access all the class slides that are available online (<a href = "https://bruigtp.github.io/website_curs_bioestadistica_R/slides.html">Slides</a>).
