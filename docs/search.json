    "text": "This course is an introduction to the use of the open-source software R for clinical data analysis. The course covers the theoretical foundations of descriptive statistics, between-group comparisons, hypothesis testing, linear and logistic regression, and survival analysis. These sessions will be combined with more hands-on sessions where students will see real-world examples using R. Students will also learn how to interpret results obtained with R and how to use these results to make decisions.\nIn this website you will find how to install all the materials in your computer using R (Install materials) and access all the class slides that are available online (Slides)."
